# ParkSpace-EYhackathon
This repository contains code and schematics on the development process of ParkSpace, an RFID based parking space solution. 

<h2>ParkSpace </h2>
<p>To solve the issues of fuel wastage and inability to find parking spots, project ParkSpace looks to facilitate a smart and efficient organization of parking systems that can be employed in cities to help curb the above stated issues.
  
With ParkSpace, the number plate of each vehicle will be embedded with a RFID tag which will be unique to every vehicle.The tagID will be mapped to the vehicle number. All the parking spots in a given area will have individual modules which will be placed inside the ground and will be covered with hard glass. Each such module will contain a RFID sensor module, an IR sensor, a Real time clock and two leds. When a vehicles RFID tag actuates the RFID reciever as well as the IR sensor, a timer keeps track of the amount of time a vehicle spends on a given parking spot. The status of if a given spot is occupied or not can then be seen on an overlay.
